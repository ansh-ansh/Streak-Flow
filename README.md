# Streak-Flow
A gamified task planner that turns productivity into a challenge. Track daily goals, build streaks, and visualize progress on a clean dashboard that motivates you to stay consistent.

It lets you do:

Registration/Login (optional if just local storage).

Task Creation – daily/weekly/monthly tasks.

Streak System – tasks marked done increase streaks (break = streak reset).

Progress Dashboard – calendar view of completed tasks + streaks.

Tags/Categories – e.g. “Study,” “Health,” “Work.”

Simple Notifications/Reminders (even just a banner inside app).
